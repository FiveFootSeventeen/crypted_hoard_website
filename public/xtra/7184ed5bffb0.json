  "prompt": "Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication.  'I have not the pleasure of understanding you,' said he",
  "story": "'nor of being acquainted with your family.' \n'I am sure I do not know what you mean,' replied she, blushing. \nHe looked at her for a few moments in silence; then he said, very gravely: 'You are too young to be familiar with such things as these.' She coloured more deeply and could say nothing. He continued: 'Mimes never interest me; they always seem to me the most ridiculous creatures in the world. But if you really wish to see one, I will show you into Mrs. Reynolds's room\u2014she is mime mistress here\u2014and we can go together.'\n \nShe was extremely gratified, and they went off in search of Mrs. Reynolds; but she could not help hearing him say to himself as they walked away: 'The shark will eat them all up before the end of the week!'\nMr. Bennet's prediction proved to be correct, and by the end of the week there was not a mime left in the house. The shark had devoured them all. Mrs. Reynolds was distraught, but Mr. Bennet merely shrugged his shoulders and said: 'I told you so.'"
