  "prompt": "The July which immediately succeeded my marriage was made memorable by three cases of interest, in which I had the privilege of being associated with Sherlock Holmes and of studying his methods.\n",
  "story": "The first was a case of robbery, in which the victim had been left with only his watch and chain. Holmes's examination of the scene of the crime led him to believe that it could have been accomplished by no other means than by someone who knew exactly where to look for what they were seeking. He therefore set out to make inquiries among those whom he considered likely candidates for having committed this dastardly deed-among thieves, ruffians, and professional beggars. Finally he came upon one fellow whose antecedents seemed sufficiently bad to warrant investigation-a man named Charlie McCarthy, alias The Baconian.\"\n\"It soon became evident,\" continued Holmes as I sat beside him listening intently while he recounted his findings from various interviews and observations during our search for clues at 221B Baker Street \"that McCarthy not only belonged firmly within the ranks of London's underworld but also possessed an uncanny knowledge about bacon products.\"\n\"Bacon products?\" I repeated, somewhat perplexed.\n\"Yes, Watson,\" said Holmes with a smile, \"bacon products. It was this knowledge that led me to believe he was the one who had robbed our client.\"\n\"How so?\" I asked.\n\"Well, you see,\" explained Holmes, \"when I questioned McCarthy about the robbery, he was very evasive and tried to change the subject whenever bacon came up. It was only when I threatened to have him arrested that he finally confessed.\"\n\"So it turns out,\" concluded Holmes as we relaxed in our armchairs after solving the case, \"that The Baconian is nothing more than a petty thief with a penchant for pork products.\"\n"
