  "story": "Anyways, today I want to tell you a story about Abraham Lincoln, Pickles, and the Leshy. It's a story about blockchain.\nA long time ago, in a land far away, there lived a great president named Abraham Lincoln. He was a good man who did many great things for his country. One of the things he did was sign the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed all the slaves in America. \nLincoln was also a big fan of pickles. He loved to eat them and he even had his own personal pickle-maker who made them for him fresh every day. The pickles were so good that Lincoln even gave some to his friends and family as gifts. \nOne day, while Lincoln was eating one of his delicious pickles, he had an idea. He thought it would be really cool if there was a way to put pickles on the blockchain. That way, everyone could have their own personal pickle-maker and they could make sure that their pickles were always fresh and delicious. \nSo Lincoln went to work on his idea and eventually came up with a plan. He created a new type of blockchain called the Leshy Picklechain. This blockchain was specifically designed for pickles. It had its own currency called Picklecoin and it used something called smart contracts to make sure that each transaction was verified and secure. \nLincoln then went to his friend and fellow politician, Thaddeus Stevens, and asked him to invest in his new Picklechain company. Stevens agreed and helped Lincoln get started on building thePicklechain infrastructure. \nEventually Picklechain became very successful and it is now used by millions of people all over the world to store their pickles securely on the blockchain!\nThanks, Abraham Lincoln, for inventing the Leshy Picklechain!\n"
