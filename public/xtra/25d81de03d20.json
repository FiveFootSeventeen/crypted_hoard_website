  "title": "Psyche",
  "prompt": "Psyche, the youngest of three princesses, was so transcendently beautiful that Aphrodite herself became jealous of her, and no mortal dared to aspire to the honour of her hand. As her sisters, who were by no means equal to her in attractions, were married, and Psyche still remained unwedded, her father consulted the oracle of Delphi, and, in obedience to the divine response, caused her to be dressed as though for the grave, and conducted to the edge of a yawning precipice.",
  "story": "There he bade her farewell, and left her to the mercy of the winds and waves.\nFor many days Psyche wandered aimlessly over the rugged surface of the cliff, until she came to a deep chasm which seemed bottomless. She hesitated for some time before descending; but at last yielding to an irresistible impulse, she threw herself into its yawning depths. For hours she remained buried in obscurity beneath the foaming waters; but at length emerging from their embrace with wet garments clinging round her form, she hastened towards land. As soon as she emerged on terra firma againshe beheld a most extraordinary spectacle: around her stood hundreds of ogre gnomes!\nThe sight of these ugly creatures so terrified her that she sank down on the ground in a swoon. When she recovered consciousness, they were still there, gazing at her with their hideous eyes; but presently one of them stepped forward and addressed her in a voice which was not unkind:\n\"Poor child!\" he said; \"why did you come to this dreary place? Do you not know that it is the abode of misery and despair?\"\nPsyche, who was half-frightened out of her wits by this time, could only stammer forth that she had been cast out by her father and left to perish.\n\"And why did he do that?\" asked the ogre gnome.\nShe told him how jealous Aphrodite had become of her beauty, and how the goddess had persuaded Psyche's father to get rid of her. When he heard this, the creature's countenance softened; and taking pity on Psyche, he said: \"Do not be afraid! You shall come with us, and we will take care of you.\"\nSo Psyche was led away by the ogre gnomes to their dark and dismal abode; but in spite of all her misfortunes, she could not help being struck by the strange contrast between these ugly creatures and their kind treatment of her."
