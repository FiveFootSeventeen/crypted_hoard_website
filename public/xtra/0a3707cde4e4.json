  "prompt": "He had flared up more brightly than anyone in memory. And then he was gone. Yet there was ironic laughter where he had been; and his ghost still walked. That was the oddest thing: to encounter his ghost.\n",
  "story": "It was as if he had been waiting for me, just beyond the edge of things.\nI was on my way home from a late night at the library when I saw him. I didn't know his name, but I knew who he was. He was the one who always seemed to be laughing, even when there wasn't anything particularly funny going on. He was the one who everyone said was \"too smart for his own good.\" And he was the one who had disappeared three years ago without a trace.\nNow he was standing in front of me, looking as real as ever. But there was something different about him. He seemed . ransparent. Like he wasn't entirely solid.\n\"Aloys,\" he said, his voice echoing strangely in the empty street. \"I've been waiting for you.\"\nI stared at him, too shocked to speak. Then I found my voice and asked the question that had been haunting me for years: \"What happened to you?\"\nHe smiled that same ironic smile and shrugged. \"I'm not sure,\" he replied. \"One day I just woke up and I wasn't in my body anymore. I could see and hear everything around me, but no one could see or hear me.\"\n\"But how did you find me?\" I asked. \"How did you know I would be here?\"\n\"I didn't,\" he said simply. \"But I've been following you for a while now.\"\nI shivered, feeling suddenly uneasy with his presence. \"Why?\" I asked warily.\n\"What do you want from me?\"\nAloys just looked at me, his eyes shining with a strange light. \"I don't know,\" he said. \"But I think you might be able to help me.\"\nI didn't know what to say. I wanted to help him, but I didn't know how. And I was afraid of what might happen if I couldn't.\n\"Please,\" he said, his voice pleading now. \"I don't know where else to turn.\"\nI hesitated for a moment longer, and then I nodded. \"All right,\" I said. \"I'll help you.\"\nAnd so began my quest to find out what had happened to Aloysius Xarathos- or as we came to call him, the Elf.\n"
