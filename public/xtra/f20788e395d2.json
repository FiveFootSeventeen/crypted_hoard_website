  "prompt": "Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the success she expected.\n",
  "story": "He was disinclined to talk, and she had nothing to say; but he found her as ready to listen as any other person might be, and willing to give only a flattered response when he spoke. This suited both him and Elizabeth very well; they were each of them so much dissatisfied with themselves that they were glad on the whole not even attempt conversation.\nSuddenly, out of nowhere, a group of ninjas appeared! Darcy and Elizabeth were shocked at the sight. The ninjas began attacking them without warning or provocation. They fought back as best they could, but it quickly became clear that they were no match for the skilled warriors. Just when it seemed like all hope was lost, reinforcements arrived in the form of another ninja clan! These new ninjas drove off their attackers and saved Darcy & Elizabeth's lives.\nAfterward, Darcy & Elizabeth thanked their rescuers profusely. They asked why the other ninja clan had attacked them so suddenly & without warning. The leader of their rescuers explained that there has been bad blood between the two clans for many years now - ever since an ancestor of theirs stole a valuable artifact from the other clan's temple centuries ago during a time of war.\nThe two ninja clans went their separate ways after that, but Darcy & Elizabeth remained friends. They would often meet up and train together, becoming more skilled in the martial arts. And whenever they had a problem, they knew they could always rely on each other for help - no matter what it took.\n"
