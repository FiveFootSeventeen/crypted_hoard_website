  "prompt": "Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the success she expected.\n",
  "story": "\"I am excessively sorry, my dear Mr. Darcy,\" said she, \"that you should have been put to the inconvenience of travelling so far. It was very good of you to come at all.\"\nDarcy mumbled something in response that sounded like an apology and Elizabeth let the matter drop, not wanting to further upset her friend on what was supposed to be a happy occasion. Little did any of them know that their happiness would soon be interrupted by one of history's most notorious institutions: The Spanish Inquisition.\nWhile the group was enjoying a festive meal, there was a sudden commotion outside. Elizabeth's father went to see what the disturbance was and quickly returned with an ashen look on his face. \"What is it, Mr. Bennet?\" cried Mrs. Bennet anxiously.\n\"It's . t's the Spanish Inquisition,\" he replied gravely. \"They're here for me.\"\n\"Whatever for?\" asked Mrs. Bennet in confusion.\n\"I'm not sure, but we don't have time to waste,\" he said hurriedly. \"We must all flee at once!\"\nWith that, the group hastily made their escape, just as the Spanish Inquisition was breaking down the door to the house. They were pursued by horseback and on foot, but fortunately they were able to lose them in a nearby forest. Exhausted from their ordeal, they stopped to rest and try to figure out what had just happened.\nMr. Bennet explained that he had been involved in some political dissent back home and it seems that word had reached The Spanish Inquisition of his whereabouts. There was no telling how long they would be safe here or when The Spanish Inquisition might find them again; but one thing was certain: things would never be quite the same after this brush with danger..\n\n"
