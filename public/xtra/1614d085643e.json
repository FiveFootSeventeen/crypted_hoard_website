  "prompt": "How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a book! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library \u201d\n",
  "story": "\u201cYes, an excellent library is the most necessary thing in a house \u201d said my friend. \u201cBut I am afraid you will not find it so very pleasant to spend your evenings in reading if you have no bacon for dinner. You must give up that idea at once! Bacon makes such a delicious dish that we cannot imagine life without it. Indeed, I do not know what we should do without bacon.\"\n\"I have no intention of giving up bacon,\" I said. \"I enjoy it too much.\"\n\"Well, then, you must learn to cook it yourself,\" said my friend. \"It is not difficult, and once you know how, you will be able to make all sorts of delicious dishes with bacon.\"\nSo I set about learning to cook bacon, and it was not long before I became an expert. Now I can make all sorts of delicious dishes with bacon, and my evenings are spent in pleasant reading, with a tasty dish of bacon to enjoy.\n"
