  "story": "A throng of bearded men, in sad-colored garments, and gray, steeple-crowned hats, intermixed with women, some wearing hoods and others bareheaded, was assembled in front of a wooden edifice, the door of which was heavily timbered with oak, and studded with iron spikes.\nThe group was evidently about to enter, for they were murmuring and exchanging looks. Suddenly a goblin appeared in the doorway, holding up his hand as if to stay them. He was small enough that he could have passed through the door without being noticed by anyone but an expert eye; nevertheless there seemed something startlingly unusual about him. His face was greenish-black, with large eyes set deep in their sockets and a pointed nose which looked like it had been broken at least once. The goblins are known for their cunning intelligence and quick wits - qualities which would seem well suited to playing tricks on humans who might be entering their lair unannounced!\nThe goblin spoke in a high-pitched voice, \"Welcome! You have come to the right place. I am here to help you on your journey.\" The crowd was surprised and uncertain of what this meant but they followed him inside anyway. \nOnce everyone had entered, it became clear that there were no doors or windows - only an empty room with four walls made from solid stone blocks carved into intricate patterns. In one corner stood a large cauldron filled with steaming liquid which smelled strongly of herbs and spices; nearby lay several sacks full of coins bearing strange symbols unfamiliar to anyone present. As soon as all eyes fell upon these items, the goblin clapped his hands together three times before pointing at each person in turn saying: \"You are free now!\" \nEach member felt something lifting off their shoulders like invisible weights being removed ,  some even cried out loud for joy when they realized what he meant by those words: freedom from whatever chains held them back before entering this mysterious chamber! After thanking the creature profusely for its generosity, everyone left feeling much lighter than when they arrived...and perhaps just a little bit wiser too?\nThe goblin watched them go with a satisfied smile, for he knew that his gift of freedom was the greatest one could ever receive.\n",
